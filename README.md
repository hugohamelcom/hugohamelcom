## Hi, I'm Hugo Hamel 👋

I've been a digital bricklayer (aka pixel builder) since 2005, creating my first website at 13. At 14, I started a podcast. By 15, I had taught myself web development (CMS, PHP & MySQL), web design (Photoshop & Illustrator) and server management (Linux). I've come a long way from taking screenshots of stacked images in a Word document to make what I considered designing.

Over the last 15+ years, I worked as a digital performance analyst, conversion optimization specialist, marketing director in agencies and startups, and a growth hacker for a major Canadian corporation generating millions, and sold my AI SaaS business in 10 months.

It's simple: I'm building solutions that turn challenges into opportunities, transforming business chaos into simple and relaxing solutions.

_(Some clients even called me a 'Cyber God' for my ability to integrate technology creatively and efficiently.)_

My natural talent really lies in not just knowing "the tech" but in creatively using them together in efficient ways, and my curiosity led me to master:

🔍 **Operations**: Discover hidden inefficiencies and optimize processes for greater productivity. (Within 6 months, a client doubled their revenue from $25k/month to $50k/month.)

🤖 **Automation**: Save time by connecting tools and reducing human interaction. (A client went from working 65 hours per week to 19h/week.)

💡 **AI**: Integrate AI platforms to cut work hours and minimize errors. (A client reduced work time by 60% and delegated the rest to virtual assistants.)

💻 **Web Development**: Build lightweight solutions efficiently. (Check out my MVP agency: [vanilladevs.com/done-for-you](https://vanilladevs.com/done-for-you))

📊 **Google Sheets**: Leverage spreadsheets with custom functions. (A client managed his entire portfolio of crypto investments and returns.)

📈 **Analytics**: Gain insights to focus business efforts effectively. (A client got to know which sales channels to double down on and which funnel steps to improve.)

📢 **Marketing**: Utilize underground strategies to push boundaries. (A client generated 3x more results in 2 days, with 41% less spent than before.)

✉️ **Cold Emailing**: Scale outreach with robust email infrastructure. (A client's infrastructure was sending up to 2M emails monthly.)

🔧 **Tool Selection**: Find perfect tools tailored to business needs. (Clients refer to me as their "Wikipedia of Tools" for always knowing the right solutions.)

_**My motto**: Anything that's manually done, has a tool to replace it, a way to automate it or to make it more efficient. There is always a solution!_

If you're passionate about pushing boundaries and disrupting traditional approaches, let's connect!
